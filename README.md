# Switch-Media-Host
Host your Switch media over LAN. (Only pictures supported, for now.)

## Download
This requires PyNX, which can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/nx-python/Pynx/releases
You will also need to grab a release of Switch Media Host, found here:
https://github.com/ImmaSpoon/Switch-Media-Host/releases

## How to install
After you have installed PyNX, and downloaded the newest release of SMH, you'll need to extract the .zip file to the root of your SD Card.

That's it!

# Usage
Once you have it installed, open PyNX from the hbmenu.

Press the '../' until you reach the root directory (The '../' will disappear)

Next, select the 'Switch Media Host.py' file and run.

It should show a blank screen for 5-10 seconds, shouldn't take long.

Your switch should show you an address, go to that address on any device on the same network.

Boom! You can see and download your screenshots easily.
